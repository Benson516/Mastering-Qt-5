#Mastering Qt 5
This is the code repository for [Mastering Qt 5](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-qt-5?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786467126), published by [Packt](www.packtpub.com). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
NeuronalMotion represents to Guillaume "a different way of working." The current hierarchical organization that applies to most companies seems obsolete to him. With his own company, he wants to try something different where each employee will be emancipated.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
windows {
    SOURCES += SysInfoWindowsImpl.cpp
    HEADERS += SysInfoWindowsImpl.h 
    debug { 
        SOURCES += DebugClass.cpp
        HEADERS += DebugClass.h
    }
}
```

All the code in this book can be compiled and run from Qt Creator using Qt 5.7. You can do it from your preferred OS: Windows, Linux, or Mac OS.
About the mobile-specific chapters, either an Android or an iOS device works, but it is not mandatory (the simulator/emulator can be enough).
Chapter 6, Even Qt deserves a slice of Raspberry Pi, offers to build an application running on a Raspberry Pi. Although it is more fun if we can do it with a real Raspberry Pi, it is not necessary to have one to complete the chapter.
