# Mastering Qt 5
This is the code repository for the book [Mastering Qt 5](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-qt-5?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786467126), published by [Packt](www.packtpub.com). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish. There are two main code repositories:
* [PacktPublishing/Mastering-Qt-5](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Qt-5): created by the book publisher
* [neuronalmotion/Mastering-Qt-5](https://github.com/neuronalmotion/Mastering-Qt-5): maintained by the book authors

## Book description
We aim to teach the reader to be proficient with Qt mechanisms to resolve real world problems. We put a strong focus on the latest version of C++14 to see how it can fit with a well designed Qt 5 application.

Here is a summary of the covered topics:
* Create stunning UIs with Qt Widget and Qt Quick
* Develop powerful, cross-platform applications with the Qt framework
* Design GUIs with the Qt Designer and build a library in it for UI preview
* Handle user interaction with the Qt signal/slot mechanism in C++
* Prepare a cross-platform project to host a third-party library
* Build a Qt application using the OpenCV API
* Use the Qt Animation framework to display stunning effects
* Deploy mobile apps with Qt and embedded platforms

## Authors
[Guillaume Lazar](https://github.com/orgs/neuronalmotion/people/GuillaumeLazar) and [Robin Penea](https://github.com/orgs/neuronalmotion/people/synapticvoid) are software engineers living near Paris in France. They founded NeuronalMotion together in 2014 to implement their vision of entrepreneurship and project development. They aim to achieve a self-organized company. More information is available at www.neuronalmotion.com.

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
windows {
    SOURCES += SysInfoWindowsImpl.cpp
    HEADERS += SysInfoWindowsImpl.h 
    debug { 
        SOURCES += DebugClass.cpp
        HEADERS += DebugClass.h
    }
}
```

All the code in this book can be compiled and run from Qt Creator using Qt 5.7. You can do it from your preferred OS: Windows, Linux, or Mac OS.
About the mobile-specific chapters, either an Android or an iOS device works, but it is not mandatory (the simulator/emulator can be enough).
Chapter 6, Even Qt deserves a slice of Raspberry Pi, offers to build an application running on a Raspberry Pi. Although it is more fun if we can do it with a real Raspberry Pi, it is not necessary to have one to complete the chapter.
